## run command: 
before run the code, please visit https://github.com/nghorbani/human_body_prior to install the human_body_prior package 

`python evaluate.py`
for evaluation

our data preprocessing is shown as `preprocess.py`

## data download 
before running the code, you may need to download ckpt.zip and data.zip from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rxYTv5j8G-10Sxy1gwmZrP-NUHJPVqyo?usp=drive_link
or from Figshare "xiao, xuan; wang, Jiangjian; Feng, Pingfa; Gong, Ao; Zhang, Xiangyu; Zhang, Jianfu (2024). Test dataset and checkpoint of the paper: Fast Human Motion Reconstruction from Sparse IMUs considering the human shape. figshare. Dataset. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25282732"
and unzip them to the folder ./ckpt and ./data respectively。

## data explain:

>_dip_betas.pt_: 
>>the regressed body shape parameters of DIP-IMU objects

>_imu_test.pt_: 
>>the data of preprocessed DIP_IMU raw data, 
including: 'acc' for data of accelerometer, 'ori' for data of gyroscope, 'pose' for gt values.
