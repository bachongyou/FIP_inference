## run command: 
before run the code, please visit https://github.com/nghorbani/human_body_prior to install the human_body_prior package 

`python evaluate.py`
for evaluation

our data preprocessing is shown as `preprocess.py`

## data download 
before running the code, you may need to download ckpt.zip and data.zip from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rxYTv5j8G-10Sxy1gwmZrP-NUHJPVqyo?usp=drive_link

and unzip them to the folder ./ckpt and ./data respectivelyã€‚

## data explain:

>_dip_betas.pt_: 
>>the regressed body shape parameters of DIP-IMU objects
